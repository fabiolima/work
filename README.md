### Fork of CyrusNuevoDia's [iterm-workspace](https://github.com/CyrusNuevoDia/iterm-workspace)

#### My changes

- The entry binary "iterm-workspace" was renamed to "work" so I can use by typing "work" instead of "iterm-workspace".
- The configuration file was renamed to ".work" instead of ".iterm-workspace" just because.

Thank you [@CyrusNuevoDia](https://github.com/CyrusNuevoDia) for the great automation tool!
